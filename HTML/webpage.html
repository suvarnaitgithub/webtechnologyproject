    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian
        aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
        raised in Rameswaram, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" target="_blank">Tamil Nadu</a> and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades
        as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Research_and_Development_Organisation" target="_blank"> Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</a>
        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
        military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on
        the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal
        organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
        original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiling_Buddha" target="_blank" >nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]</a>

        Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party" target="_blank">Bharatiya Janata Party</a>
        and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he
        returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient
        of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

        While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
        apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended
        the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]</p>
